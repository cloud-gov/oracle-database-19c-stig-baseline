  title 'The Oracle Database, or the logging or alerting mechanism the application uses, must provide a warning when allocated audit record storage volume record storage volume reaches 75 percent of maximum audit record storage capacity.'
  desc 'Organizations are required to use a central log management system, so, under normal conditions, the audit space allocated to the database management system (DBMS) on its own server will not be an issue. However, space will still be required on the DBMS server for audit records in transit, and, under abnormal conditions, this could fill up. Since a requirement exists to halt processing upon audit failure, a service outage would result.

If support personnel are not notified immediately upon storage volume usage reaching 75 percent, they are unable to plan for storage capacity expansion. 

The appropriate support staff include, at a minimum, the information system security officer (ISSO) and the database administrator (DBA)/system administrator (SA).'
  desc 'check', 'Review OS or third-party logging application settings to determine whether a warning will be provided when 75 percent of DBMS audit log storage capacity is reached.

If no warning will be provided, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Modify DBMS, OS, or third-party logging application settings to alert appropriate personnel when 75 percent of log storage capacity is reached.

For ease of management, it is recommended that the audit tables be kept in a dedicated tablespace.

If Oracle Enterprise Manager is in use, the capability to issue such an alert is built in and configurable via the console so an email can be sent to a designated administrator.

If Enterprise Manager is unavailable, the following script can be used to monitor storage space; this can be combined with additional code to email the appropriate administrator so they can take action.

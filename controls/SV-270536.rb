Review OS DBA group membership.

If any developer accounts, as identified in the system documentation, have been assigned DBA privileges, this is a finding.

Note: Though shared production/nonproduction DBMS installations was allowed under previous database STIG guidance, doing so may place it in violation of OS, Application, Network, or Enclave STIG guidance. Ensure that any shared production/nonproduction DBMS installation meets STIG guidance requirements at all levels or mitigates any conflicts in STIG guidance with the authorizing official (AO).'

Do not assign production DBA OS group membership to accounts used for development.

Remove development accounts from production DBA OS group membership.

Recommend establishing a dedicated DBMS host for production DBMS installations. A dedicated host system in this case refers to an instance of the operating system at a minimum. The operating system may reside on a virtual host machine where supported by the DBMS vendor.'

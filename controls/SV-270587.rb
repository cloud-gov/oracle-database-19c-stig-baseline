  desc 'Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of whether they are used in single-factor or multifactor authentication (MFA). Long passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery can occur, for example, in situations when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof.'
  desc 'check', "Verify the database management system (DBMS) is configured to verify when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords in IA-5 (1) (a).

If all user accounts are authenticated by the OS or an enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism, and not by Oracle, this is not a finding.

For each profile that can be applied to accounts where authentication is under Oracle's control, determine the password verification function that is in use:

SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_PROFILES 
WHERE RESOURCE_NAME = 'PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION'
ORDER BY PROFILE;

Note: Profiles can inherit settings from another profile so some password functions could be set to DEFAULT. If so, review the DEFAULT profile function name. 

If the function name is null for any profile, this is a finding.

Review the password verification functions specified for the PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION settings for each profile. Determine whether it is configured for when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords.
 
If the verify_function is not configured to verify when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in IA-5 (1) (a), this is a finding."

  desc 'Applications, including database management systems (DBMSs), must prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources. Permitting only DBMS processes and authorized, administrative users to have access to the files where the database resides helps ensure that those files are not shared inappropriately and are not open to backdoor access and manipulation.'

On Unix Systems:

  ls -ld [pathname]

Substitute [pathname] with the directory path where the database files, logs, and database backup files are located.
(examples: /*/app/oracle/oradata/db_name, /*/app/oracle/oradata/db_name/audit, and /*/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area/db_name) 

If permissions are granted for world access, this is a finding.

If any user/role who is not an authorized system administrator with a need to know or database administrator with a need to know, or a system account for running DBMS processes, is permitted to read/view any of these files, this is a finding.

On Windows Systems (from Windows Explorer):

Browse to the directory specified (example: %ORACLE_BASE%\\oradata and %ORACLE_BASE%\\fast_recovery_area). Select and right-click on the directory >> Properties >> Security tab. On Windows hosts, records are also written to the Windows application event log. The location of the application event log is listed under Properties for the log under the Windows console. The default location is C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\config\\EventLogs\\AppEvent.Evt.

Select and right-click on the directory >> Properties >> Security tab.

If permissions are granted to everyone, this is a finding.

If any user/role who is not an authorized system administrator with a need to know or database administrator with a need to know, or a system account for running DBMS processes permitted to read/view any of these files, this is a finding.'
